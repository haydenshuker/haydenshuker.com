<h1>Blog #7: Barbie Dreamhouse Imagination</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-1-21">January 21, 2024</p>
<p>Because I have a tendency for living complacently in college bachelor tier conditions, I’ve thought about dreaming big for some perspective beyond my reality here confined to education. I am no Cinderella, I can’t produce star wishes and I am tranquil enough to accept living for the minute, domestic and sensory. So here is a wish framed in the minute, domestic and sensory: the barbie dreamhouse.</p>
<p>I love houses with tiny distinct rooms. The size of each can be as small as a half thoreau cabin. I don’t care about space as long as it can fit a table or single couch. I know America doesn’t like this, but I kind of want to live in a massive generational family unit. A lot of rooms for a lot of people. The massive open space trend turned every house into a bachelor pad.</p>
<p>Hiring outside labor makes the lifestyle cold and transactional like this dorm life. I share a room up here. Living with someone else takes me back to when I had housecats. Their little cat lives and fur in my laundry reminded me I wasn’t an island. I'm not a fan of sterility. The room is split down the middle between me and my roommate’s non performative mundane, always in the corner of my vision. On my other side is the window by my desk, with Philadelphia as an epic expanse. From there three surfaces meet to partition my home, and three more hug Temple units. 
<p>Back home I had the standard one roomroom just for me. It was unfortunately in the corner but with one tiny window. Instead of the expanse I had a creek and foliage for a view. There are enough locations for me to not worry about losing this one specifically.</p>
<p>What’s important about the kitchen is that it stays walled off from the living room. HGTV unfairly made it a social focus. My kitchen would have just a stove-oven, kettle and microwave for heat, and a relaxingly confined set of utensils. I would own a chest freezer for buying whole cows from the amish. Bathrooms have glass doors enclosing the shower and a bathtub incase I get neurotic.</p>
<p>I like a private area to unfold my work or else everyone else gets mad. Currently my desk is a computer office, little music lounge and coffee kitchen with my kettle dangerously on the floor behind my bass until I can afford a table and a paper quart of heavy cream on my desk threatening my goodwill keyboard. I like to be able to pack all my stuff away when I get sick of it.</p>
<p>I think if you are found dead in the woods, it’s less embarrassing if your corpse doesn’t have expensive gear on it. Music making is instrument golf if golf was about getting rid of clubs instead of strokes. Multiple instruments are best with multiple people. I would rather play the saxophone than the whole studio. Computers brilliantly fit together like hamster enclosures. The dream of the musky hacker nest is only as good as my skill on the laptop compressed keyboard. So it should probably all pack into the closet too.</p>
<p>I don't want a car life so the garage becomes a workshop. It’s warm in winter's indoor season, and has padded enough floors and chairs so it can accidently become a living room in the evening. I don't need to live lavishly but I think humanity's default state is comfort.</p>
<p>I want a conservatory with plants in the winter time and maybe a new generation of cats in the sun. I want a reasonable way of getting onto the roof. The building fits in with its neighbors, its front is flush with the street, its sides flush with shared walls. The front has big windows for the most lively rooms, and the back hosts a garden too intricate to be a yard. I dread moving out of this dorm just for losing this view, but I will admit there are extravagant equivalents in this city buyable with money. If not the round earth I want the tight corridors here with streets too thin for parking.</p>
<p>I can imagine the Barbie dreamhouse, it’s mostly just a social situation better than the stock one for students. If the house and objects are not extravagant I’m not doing it for the money. I don’t need much justification for my willingness to churn out physics homework so long as my innate passion keeps me coming back to that kind of tedium and frustration. I’m still wondering why I do this.</p>
