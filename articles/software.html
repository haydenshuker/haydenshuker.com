<h1>For Everyone:</h1>
<p><a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/>Firefox</a>: Basically every other browser is controlled by google. </p>
<p><a href=https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html>Charter Font</a>: Gives you a nice serif look while doing above the bare minimum with your typography.</p>

<h1>For Computer People:</h1>
<p><a href=https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/>Thunderbird</a>: Collecting all your email and RSS into a real offline program feels like a captain's chair for the internet.</p>
<p><a href=https://micro-editor.github.io/>Micro</a>: Everybody needs a text editor that works in the terminal. I like this one because it works like any other modern program like the text input in Firefox or thunderbird. The others like Vim and Nano have these legacy systems of keybindings and operation. If you want a normal terminal text editor, use Micro.</p>
<p><a href=https://archlinux.org/>Arch Linux</a>: I got a computer genius friend who hyped me into Arch when I was dithcing Window 11 instead of like Mint or something. I would like to thank him for that because just by trying to use this thing I have turned into a low level baby IT guy. Now that I am proficient, I like the under engineering type philosophy this thing is made with.</p>
<p><a href=https://swaywm.org/>Sway Window Manager</a>: Most interfaces feel like they have indigestion compared to Sway. My iPhone especially feels slow and floaty.
<p><a href=https://www.gnome.org/>Gnome/GNU</a>: A person using something as out there as a tiling window manager should probably have some tight, unique boutique program for everything. But when I need a tool, I know <a href=https://stallman.org/>Richard Stallman</a> and his boys have me covered down to the principles. I like the Gnome file explorer, disk tools, text editor (gedit), and font tools especially.</p>
