<h1>Mohnton Bunny Boy</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-07-11">July 11th, 2024</p>
<p>Today I learned how to bunny hop.</p>
<p>Now the world opens to me, the whole bike skill tree. I could learn to track stand and pair it with my little euro hop and get technical. I could up my power and learn the full J hop and those manuals. I could take my little hop to the trails and learn to use it for real speed for men. I love that about bikes. They are almost a basic archetypal human tool. Its a shame they didn’t get invented earlier. It pairs so well with the human body in ways we explore like the hammer or sword.</p>
<p>I actually did fencing for a bit. Fencing has no tricks that's the problem with the sport. You can’t flex your fencing kata. Everything you learn has to be against a guy to mean anything, and then your guy goes and does something else and your tricks are ruined. You are bound to your guy, and you are both bound to this rectangle on the ground. You put your thick sweaty white clothes back in the bag and you go home and its like nothing ever happened. Call that practicality, or versatility, transferability, flexibility, fencing has none of them. It is a small little game.</p>
<p>I have nothing against swords. They encompass the world, you can die by one. Grind and sharpen the blade until there is nothing left and you get ‘modern sport fencing’— a phenomenon split and excreted from the great rich asshole duels us white people used to like.</p>
<p>So that is my problem. When I’m teaching somebody a skill or hobby I try to stay away from ‘when you’ or ‘once you’ statements. Like “when you practice enough, you’ll be able to…” because those sorts of lines are daunting. Its like looking your entire future in the mouth. Will I stick with this skill enough to practice that thoroughly? Will I find some reason to do this? Do I want to commit to this that long? Will I live that long? Respect the cannon and the commitment, but please don’t toss me into it just yet. Just give me the moment. “Hey kid now you know algebra you can do all kinds of accounting”, not “this will come back in differential equations so you better remember it.”</p>
