<h1>Blog #5: STEM Meat</h1>

<p>I’m a registered mechanical engineering major now. I’ve dropped statistics and modeling, now I’m taking statics and CAD class. Switching from industrial gave me the new haircut experience “oh my god you look so much better now”. I needed to contort industrial out of having bullshit vibes and civil into being fun. Mechanical splits the difference between the two and fills in the center with the practical stuff. If I picked wrong I could nightschool pivot my way into one of the other two.</p>
<p>I think one major tragedy or mental break and I lose all my attachment and go Diogenes mode. I'm optimizing for living in a van by the river. In that situation I control the van not the river, so it’s better to go mechanical than civil. For class selection I like to take straight bricks— all courses no sides. If I want to take fluff classes (industrial/systems engineering) I’ll do it after I’ve gotten a job and eaten all these straight bricks.<p>
<p>Electrical engineering is honestly straight heat all the way down the list. Our school has a recurring ‘engineering computation’ saga that pops up in most majors usually as a little  technical elective dip. Industrial comes with engineering computation standard but because that major is easy business mode it can be traded down to fluffier alternatives like python class. Electrical classic takes you to II, Electrical with the computing concentration takes you to III, and you can technical elective it all the way to IV. Electrical also gets this thick series of ‘electronic devices’ made of 5 credit fucking meatballs.</p>
<p>Brothers civil and mechanical get the old timey physics series instead (Statics, solids, dynamics and fluid dynamics). Maybe I was drawn to civil because of its boring older brother vibe. Little brother mechanical gets shop class and your choice of electives (regular, space, or car). Civil classic gets concrete class, Civil environmental gets wastewater class.</p>
<p>Bioengineering makes me sleepy.</p>
<p>One of my big problems with industrial is that they don't have a big meat series gauntlet that turns you into a wizard; they just have business class. Maybe that stuff makes you some wall street demon, probably it's medium articles and fake science. Industrail does have some hot finales, but that's only after 3 seasons of filler. It requires scale and a unified labor force as its medium making it worthless in the river situation.<p>
<h1>Postscript:</h1>
<p>To complete the family gender analogy: in a separate but related family, chemical is male and bisexual, bio is his little sister and after a sizable age gap there is littlest sister environmental (aro/ace). Their father is petroleum and evil. In another separate but related family, electrical (he/they) is an only child and computer engineering is his fursona.</p>
