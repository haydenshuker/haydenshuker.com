<h1>(Mini) Essay #3: Using Some Imagination</h1>

<p>I like to imagine my ignorance. Literally I will look around thinking “I don’t know how the overhead lights work, I don’t know his relationship with his mom, I don’t know who last cleaned these floors”. I keep going until I blot out my surroundings. It feels like looking for dark matter. This is only mostly metaphorical, I literally imagine objects, surfaces and concepts I don’t understand as this black void. What remains of what I do understand are these silky fibers lining vague discernible shapes. This pairs nicely with a similar trick: “what am I satisfied with?” Where I imagine my vision in a similar way. Here everything gradually lights up to a pleasant green. What does not light up can give me a good indication if I need to sit on a softer chair or use the bathroom. Obviously I have been thinking about engineering a lot so the satisfaction lens has an inanimate variant for people who care too much about stuff that doesn’t matter: is this well engineered? Yes, most everything here is sturdy enough and really solves my problems. Sure looking outside there are some issues with the roads and supply chains and stuff but I already fight those rain clouds with vigorous intent. If anything they did too good a job and my sight tells me “overengineering!” but that is a later argument.
