<h1>Essay #2: Keyboard Takes</h1>
<p><time datetime="2023-11-23">November 23, 2023, <i>Happy Thanksgiving</i></time></p>

<p>It’s crazy that we can convert finger dexterity to language. How that happens, like language itself, needs some agreements so we all learned qwerty and built keyboards with qwerty even though we all know devorak or whatever is probably better. I’ve tried to learn alternative layouts, but they come at the cost of forgetting qwerty, and the connection that comes with it, be that other peoples computers, the terminal at the library or all the old typewriters. It takes a quantity of practice better given to the piano or trombone.</p>
<p>Just about every key that's not on the typewriter, and some of the harder to reach ones that are, are given such sub-prime placement on most mainstream keyboard layouts that most people probably don’t have any habits to disrupt by moving them. Thus the placement of anything more than a key away from home-row has been fair game to put wherever, for better and for worse.</p>
<h1>The Dell XPS 13 Keyboard</h1>
<p>This is my laptop’s keyboard and it’s fairly representative of compact laptop keyboards as a whole. I’ve been on the journey towards mastering this design, not that it has rewarded me for doing so.</p>

<p>I’m nearly able to touch type on the numbers but raising up for their row feels strenuous from inline home row typing, and clunky for calculator style math writing compared to the whole num-pad suite. The function layer is a real mess, it’s a missed opportunity to layer something in the middle of the alphabetical section. The FN key feels like a dead space in between the important modifier keys. The navigation cluster gets scattered into the corners, I think home and end feel more comfortable next to their brothers page up and page down. I dislike dropping my right hand for the arrows, especially in some couch laptop posture. I’ll completely hunt-&-peck for the function row at the very top. I know this is baked into qwerty, but way too much garbage is given to the right pinky. Right shift, enter and especially backspace are out in exile past the slashes and brackets.</p>
<h1>The IBM Model M</h1>
<p>I’ve got a second keyboard, coincidentally also made by Dell but really it was IBM’s idea. I think I got it for 30 minites of disassembling computers on a middle school field trip. This thing became the ISO standard for a reason.</p>

<p>Shrinking for the laptop took the elegance of the 100%. It feels like the natural computer extension of the qwerty typewriter. The spacing between the various sections and function keys reminds me of the space around the black keys on a piano. The nav cluster devolved from a complete mode of thought your right hand would find by feel, to a broken collection of keys to be reassembled with lots of experience and memorization. Despite the neatness of the three sections, spreading out the various clusters gives the right hand a big distance to travel. I’d rather stack everything under the home row.</p>
<p>I then have two problems with the IBM: those inherited from the typewriter, and how far away all the clusters are from the home row. Solving both of these creates the 40%.</p>
<h1>The 40 Percent</h1>
<p>Keyboard people describe keyboard sizes in very rough percentages of the total 104 keys of the fullsized, 100% IBM. Removing the numpad like on my laptop's keyboard creates an ‘80%’, additionally removing the function row and some of the nav cluster makes a ‘60%’, and finally removing the number row and everything left of the nav cluster makes a ‘40%’. The math on these percentages doesn’t really cheek out, its more of a gesture with numbers than real arithmetic. Smaller sizes then 40% exist, first with especially tight sets of modifier keys, then they just become stenotypes.</p>
<img src="images/40-percent-keybaords.jpg" alt="A staggered and an ortho 40 keyboard" class="large">
<p>Here every section is stacked right on top of the alphabet using layers, like how caps-lock, shift and num-lock hide two separate functions. This solves the 100% problem of big hand moments between the three sections. How exactly this is done is consistently inconsistent. Almost every keyboard around this form-factor is hand soldered and programmed by people who nitpick about these sorts of things. Each individual owner flashes how they think a keyboard should work to a micro-controller. To solve the issues inherited from qwerty requires breaking some of the compatibility with your universal typing skill. You can split up the giant space bar, change the stagger to ether not mess with the left hand or rearrange the keys entirely to contour with the finger, remove some keys from the right pinky, or move all the non-alphabetical keys to the thumbs. Solutions here a taken à la carte and people will never stop fighting about which ones are good.</p>
