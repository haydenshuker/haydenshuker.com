<h1>Update #1 The Website Broke</h1>
<p><time datetime="2023-11-19">November 19, 2023</time></p>
</header>
<p>My website was down for the last couple weeks. That’s because I’m hosting this using google’s firebase. My website is maybe 20kb total but google is trying to sell you some kind of entrepreneur, web-app, internet-storefront-platform dream that hasn’t been cool since maybe the Obama administration. I will bite the hell out of the hand that feeds me even if they are feeding me for free by letting me latch my 20kb to their eldritch horror of a service unnoticed.</p>
<p>The real dream is self hosting, If the cloud is someone else’s computer I want to use my own, preferably a cute rack mounted thing I buy off temple university IT department for under 50$. If the only way to make money is to sell labor, of course google is going to try to sell me more labor then I want by pushing a million little bloated services to do with their giant computers. If I exert only the labor I need myself the whole thing takes less work and it comes out more virtuous anyway because true virtue uses minimal effort.</p>
<p>I use a bit of a private definition of ‘virtue’ here, I really just mean ‘good’. And I use ‘good’ in the general way that the philosophers like to try to define. It can be what every axis of quality you want to use because they are all secretly the same thing in a giant dialectic, efficiency is beauty is practicality is coolness is virtue. Thus my website is better than google because their hosting is bloated and unstable and my website loads quick and doesn’t release that much CO₂.</p>

<h1>Update #2: Cool Date!</h1>
<p><time datetime="2023-12-23">December 23, 2023, <i>cool date!</i></p>
</header>
<p>I have updated my inspiration list with some more artists and works. I like the idea of creating massive amalgamation of links for a half hours internet surfing. Expect more essays and stuff this winter as I work to ward cabin fever. Apologies for the poor copy editing. I am working to clean that up including an address for complaints and hate mail.</p>

<h1>Update #3: Meta-Writing etc.</h1>
<p><time datetime="2023-12-29"></time>December 29, 2023</p>
</header>
<p>An artist doesn't necessarily need to publish, compile, or even share, but a good person probably should though. Sometimes I like to turn on airplane mode and pretend I'm using a typewriter. If you think of me as infinite monkeys would you rather be reading Shakespeare? Every post on this site must include a medium type, colon, then a title. The medium type is the most important part; it lets you know I’m taking you places. I call this one an ‘update’ instead of a ‘bullshit text glob’ because I’m trying to get the numbers higher and ‘bullshit text glob’ would start me back at #1. I have a massive folder on my desktop called ‘prose’ filled with .txt files I write when I’m in my feelings, then I dig through them to see If I was on to something.</p>
<p>I’m trying to get my money up</p>
<h1>Menu of Services</h1>
<p>To the Philadelphia and southeastern PA region I am willing to do the following. On practical, moral and ethical grounds I refuse to preform any compensated sex work or crime. Expect a sub-professional quality.
<ul>
<li>Speaking (comedy, sermon, seminar): $1</li>
<li>Haircut and beard trim (buzz): $1</li>
<li>Therapy (unlicenced and possibly counter productive): $1</li>
<li>Visual art (dubious): 1$</li>
<li>Maintenance tech (attempted without promise of skill, otherwise labor): $1</li>
graphic design(I think I could actually do this one): $2</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Labor I can actually do to a reasonable standard costs union rates as not to undercut:
<ul>
<li>Hauling (inquire about my squat max)</li>
<li>Service</li>
<li>Driving (I want to try driving a commerical truck)</li>
<li>Cleaning</li>
<li>Child care</li>
<li>Cooking</li>
<li>Tutoring</li>
<li>Consultation: $75/hour</li>
<li>Non-Commercial Engineering (unlicenced, attempted, commercial employers know this website isn’t for you): $1,000,000/hour</li>
</ul></p>
<p>I am willing to trade for cash, raw meat, and precious metals. Currently none of my possessions are for sale but I may sell some stuff later.</p>
<p>I am usually against maintaining living documents because they tend to get forgotten and sad. But If somebody actually buys a one dollar buzz cut this is all getting pinned above my bio.</p>

<h1>Update #5: Software Recommendations</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-1-7">January 9, 2024</p>
</header>
<p>I have added <a href="articles/software.html">Software recommendations</a>. I’m bringing back the living documents for the sake of legibility. I am approaching scale problems! Firefox reader mode says my entire work here is pushing up to a 45 minute read so I am working to clean that up and make this place navigable.</p>
