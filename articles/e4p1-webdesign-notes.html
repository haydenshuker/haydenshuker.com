<h2>Part 1: Racecar Club Marketing</h2>
<p>I wrote this about the currently terrible <a href="https://sites.temple.edu/templeformularacing/">Temple Formula Racing website</a>. This argument fits better here than in the club marketing department microsoft teams chat.</p>
<p>Web design has an Icarus problem. <a href="https://www.ritformula.com/">RIT</a> and <a href="https://www.rutgersformularacing.com/join">Rutgers</a> have fine marketing landing pages but they break on mobile and have a file size that would tank on a weak connection. The style looks good as a splash screen but when you want some info (like if you were looking to sponsor) the flash gets in becomes confusing and annoying. Apple.com knows when you are vulnerable to showmanship and when you just want text on a page. They present a fullscreen graphic design spectacle on the ‘iPad’ page that gradually tapers out as you approach the buy screen. Customer service flattens to regular text organized neatly and unobtrusively with icons and column sub sections.</p>
<p>For virtue and legitimacy, I trust a site with <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">good performance</a>, <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">beautiful effort and detail in mundane elements</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">organized and frequently updated text</a>. Sites with spacious graphics and generous use of animation don't look like real sites of real organizations, they look like the marketing for  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170824175744/https://www.juicero.com/">lairs, amateurs and scammers</a> using stock templates or outsourced design work. Legit organizations like Apple or Toyota or whoever have dense, navigable and up to date information that makes them look legitimate, the flare is there to work the subconscious.</p>
