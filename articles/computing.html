<h2>Youtube over RSS</h2>
<p>You can get a youtube channel rss feed by inspecting the page source for a channel page, and then digging for the .xml link. They include a long serial number which I don't think there is a good way to find anywhere else. </p>

<h2>Exporting Apple Contacts</h2>
  <p>You can export your apple contacts (if you wanted to quit IOS) by zooming out to lists, long pressing on a list and selecting “export”. It exports as a file format called .vcf or “Vitual Contact Format”, or (and I'm not kidding) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">vCard</a>. You can then inport these into an open contacts manager like Thunderbird. For me, including contact photos blew up the file size and broke the export file. So when exporting, exclude contact photos.</p>
