<h1>Blog #1: Why I Made This Website</h1>

<p>Making this website was easy but only for a person like me. I grew up poking around on the computer and making games and stuff. I could figure out what buttons to push on go daddy dot com because I've developed a subconscious sense for the weird ways a computer wants to work. I'm not free from the the mainstream social media sites either. I could evangelize federated media, or tiny blogs or whatever but the truth is the only people who use those things are the nerds like me who want to deal with stuff like that. I've read too many posts about the free internet open foss libre whatever. Really I want to watch the comedian, video essayist, artists on youtube or read the memes made by people with something more to say than their computer IT skills. The job here has a technical gate but this is really media and prose and art. </p>
<p>That being said, damn this free and open shit is awesome. My brother said my site loads instantly and fits his dinky phone perfectly. People love real minimalism when you give it to them. I give it to myself all the time. My computer runs like hot garbage. The bluetooth doesn't work, sometimes an update will become a mess, I'm not entirely sure how to connect to wifi without looking it up on the internet which can become a problem. Free and open is not as hard as I make it, I kind of love living in this leaky roofed house, but I'm a weird person who ether likes computer problems, or I’m willing to give up on the computer if I don't want to solve them. Its like those guys with the Honda civics with the AC taken out, the dream is to go fast enough with the windows down that the heat isn't a big deal. I say I don't like computers sometimes but I do like computers. I don't like the companies and their big dumb programs but that's not the fault of the nor-gates or the directory trees. I like all the raw basic tools, like the terminal, HTML, hammers, swords, bicycles, tongs. Using these tools are like the free-wights, they train the little muscles that the machines don't, and there is something more fun about balancing a dumbbell rather than pulling a bolted in lever.</p>
<p>Then there's the media aspect. I wouldn't call myself an artist but I would say everyone is innately an artist. I like writing essays and jokes and poems, and I think I should be talking at least as loud as some of these other idiots on the internet. The music I’m making at the moment ranges from trite to clearly incompetent. I'm not the kind of person who could crank out works all alone for no audience. I think the people who can go on to become outsider art legends but personally I prefer the social aspect too. Its hard to release, especially if you're like me and you have a violent distrust of social media but no website. Now I have a website, so I can release, and I get to be an artist more.</p>
