<h1>Essay #1: The Library Of Craigslist</h1>

<p>Some durable goods, even mass-produced ones, take in the shape of the their user’s soul like a sole takes the shape of the foot. The obvious examples are the items easily called artworks, the sketchbooks and patched up jackets of all disciplines. Thus the inverse is true, an item that can’t be customized forms to no soul. To the most extreme end of this side of the spectrum of possessions is the deliberately fungible cash, next come the houses and stock cars, everything bought to be resold. These commodity items aren't metaphysically connected to their owner, their ownership is more like a hoard of withdraws from the library of Craigslist.</p>
<p>A car looses value if it’s modified, even if those modifications improve the quality of the car. Houses notoriously became that homogeneous gray-beige for the sake of resale-value. Generally, if the full rights of ownership are utilized, one is punished with a decrease in its worth. You can do more with a library book than one you want to resell, you could read it in the bath or take it to the beach because its damaged value is shared by the society. </p>
<p>To get maximal use out of a commodity, one must be the last in the series of owners who finally chooses to nuke the resale value and fully smash their soul into the items surface. This creates an awkward middle ground when an item that doesn’t get adopted as a personality piece, nor ran back-into-the dust-from-whence-it-came, but also can’t be resold for a reasonable price worth the effort of selling. These items that are still full of utility get lost in the limbo of marginal value. Over-production fueled store shelves make the used things unfairly worthless to the market. These things get discarded before their lifespan is over, go to thrift stores or get hoarded. In each case, the buyer is punished by getting fractional value of a good they paid full price for.</p>
<p>Then to abandon the difficultly of moving items though the competitive, labor intensive, pain in the ass that is the market, items may be bought and owned collectively to ensure maximum durability expenditure from each item. Anybody could pay into access a pool of stuff, and borrow anything not worth owning but still worth using. They are expected to reasonably return an item while only consuming a fair share of durability, and may be held accountable by getting collection access revoked if they don't. This is obviously just the library redescribed from first principles. I’m in a library right now, I wouldn’t pay for all these books, rooms, and computers, but I would pay a tiny fraction of their combined value to suck a little bit of durability out of a lot of them. </p>
<p>I dream that one day they could have stand mixers, lawnmowers, basketballs, bicycles, vans, boardgames, kilns, and rifles all in here along side the books and the computers. The librarians seem to know this, they are all filling out their library-of-things collections. Still, they have lots of chairs, cozy isles of books and many conference rooms not used after hours. They could let a somebody stay the night if they obey the same rules as checking out a book. The inefficiency under current practice frustrates me.</p>
