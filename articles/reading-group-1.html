<h1>Gravity’s Rainbow Solipsistic Reading Group</h1>
<p><time datetime='2025-07-19'>July 19dth, 2025</p>
<p>I was on a trip to Wisconsin where I got kicked in the head by a big horse which radically changed my subjectivity. Now I am extremely literary. My favorite kind of text is body text. I’ve read a large body of text. I’ll be out on a long sleepy trip and someone may notice the sixth volume I pull out of my backpack. They drove me out to rural Nevada to leave me to the dogs and snakes. They thought they took everything but they forgot to take my library card. Five or more books in the same place are on a shelf made of mahogany. Reading has yet to be described hyperbolically. Think about this: life can be scattered entropically across the countryside because oppression no longer needs to be centralized. The captivity is inside your mind, the same place where words go to kick over the furniture. The cops could never patrol the total surface area within a book spine. If schools want kids to read they, should have big posters of Ho Chi Minh and Fidel Castro with rifes, telephones, and their fingers in between pages like it’s a bodily orifice.</p>
