<h1>Public Writing</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-5-4">May 4th, 2024</p>
<p>Long time writer-blogger <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulnlSRbH80Y">Cory Doctorow</a> records everything for public consumption. He carries around a little notebook and records everything that seems relivent. But because he intends on publishing everything that seems relevent, his words keep of level of claity you can't get from scrippling ugly notes to yourself.</p>
<p>I do this, I keep little notebooks in my pocket. I've been on the side of keeping it to myself. These things become incomprehenible beat up slabs. Meanwhile my published work forced a level of quality that could eject ideas that rattled in my brain.</p>
<p>For years I was whining about computer keyboard design. Qwerty and friends felt like inefficent, dated engineering. So I thought about it, and I did my complaining, and I left space for praising. Now I am at peace. I've said what I said, and now I can love the keyboard as a slice our culture rather than some nagging problem.</p>
<p>This is a cutsy, petty example. So I had a pet peeve, but I also wrote about durable goods in the commons, where I want to live, and the whole geography of my home town. Together they form a steam releasing out of me. I have a tendency to get stuck in tiny, domestic details. I over-reserch every item I own, I think about what side of my desk to put my lamp. Its like a bramble that encases my path, keeping me from progressing to bigger, or at least less stale obsession.</p>
<p>I write publicly because it forces me to explain myself for real, which forces me to resolve a thought.</p>
