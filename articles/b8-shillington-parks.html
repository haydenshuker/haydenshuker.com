<p>I think every developer in America is playing defense against my sense of wonder. They can’t win though.</p>
The Schuylkill trail is a humble southeast PA wonder. From home to school that's 60 miles, two days walk, or a day's cycle. You can walk anywhere you want blessed with the nimblist right of way so you get the best route. You should get the best route, but nobody treks anymore so you might just be walking on the side of highways. Something about that feels wrong to me. We don’t build for intercity walking or cycling, the trail is an anomaly. This is our god-given locomotion and there’s no good way to Pittsburgh on bike or foot. You share a right of way with cars, but those roads are thick and lumbering. A sub-suburban automobile scale block wastes the ability of a cyclist by being too flat, expensive, indirect and blasting them with cars. Please build more trails. Optimize your town for hour foot commutes from the countryside.</p>

<p>There are five main trail systems around the town where I went to highschool. The big one in town is the one up top: the Wyomissing park following the Wyomissing creek. It's kind of like the appellation trail of West Reading. To the east it plugs into the Reading core and the world through the Schuylkill river trail. Its eastern end is wawa. The part of the Schuylkill river trail here is fine and well maintained, but it's a shithole because it’s next to a highway. The cool parts are north and south where it runs over the old railway bridges but the shillington-kenhorst part sucks. What's interesting is that it plugs into the little Alvernia (no-learnia) Angelica creek park. The Angelica creek path continues in spirit to about the Kenhort pool. Like the wawa, the pool plugs into urban(ish) fabric so you can make a complete loop just by following the river and its tributaries. So I biked that.</p>

<p>Eight miles, maybe a couple hours, a dozen formal water crossings, two informal water crossings, drank maybe half a bottle, zero falls, zero collisions, and I ran into one of my high school history teachers. I can’t believe how much I had to dig for the route. I wish I could do this every day.</p>
<p>The fourth system tail system in the area is the long forgotten Shillington park which fades into the forested region to the south. It’s the source of Angelica tributary Rabbit Run (John Updike went to my highschool). The southern end dumps you on a massive suburban block with no good connections anywhere.</p>
<p>Fith system Nolde Forest is by far the best park here. They are the heart of environmentalism south of Reading. Their flagship trail is descriptively named ‘watershed trail’ following a tributary of Angelica with many bridges at wooden features. It's absolutely beautiful. Nobody hikes the north end because it runs by a major road, then just dumps you on it without even a trailhead. Between there and the whole park in Angelica creek's honor is only about a mile of pedestrian murdering road, but most of that is tacitly owned by the park. Two ludicrously high speed road crossings and this thing goes all the way to the atlantic. It won’t be built because that would disturb road traffic, but if you’re a hardass who can frogger it, you get the most beautiful path for yourself.</p>
