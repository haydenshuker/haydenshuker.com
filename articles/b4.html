<h1>Blog #4: Some Thoughts On My First Semester as a Temple Student</h1>

<p>College sucks you dry. Temple is a bit of a public school, meaning some of the weight above me is a mass of government bureaucracy rather than capital holders which I find more comforting. That’s why I never want to work for a ‘small business’, the weight above you there is just one asshole trying to suck you rather than some unknowable system. Preferably I'm working for the government so there’s less capital up there. More preferably it's a flat hierarchy so nobody’s sucking anybody. If you go to Drexel they suck you vigorously.</p>
<p>I'm going to college because If you don't you spend the rest of your life trying to prove you're smart. This country is all certifications and due process all the way down. A degree is a rhetorical trump card that saves you from being seen as full of shit from everyone with a degree. I could try to free ball the job market but I’m too lost to try gambling health insurance on the shriveling american dream ladder.</p>
<p>So coming from the Philadelphia watershed, I picked the big city. I don’t like rural ‘party campus’ disney lands. It’s like a euphemism, people drink the most in boring shitholes with nothing to do. In Philadelphia, I can look out the window and see who is playing by what team’s colors they light up the buildings and look down at the streets and see people wearing the jerseys. I’m an urbanist so I like walking the one lane streets with the tight sets of rowhomes. Engineers like when the train goes by an industrial park.</p>
<p>I’ve been struggling with picking my engineering discipline. Even the grown adult engineers I’ve talked to get catty about what team they’re on. My schedule pushed me ahead too fast so now I’m picking before I got fully immersed in this world. I’m trying to guess what these jobs would be like to a minute level like: “how much walking would I do?”, “how much computer time is there?”, “would I be going outside?”, “if I ever want to become a rural hermit crank would my skills be useful for homesteading?”. I’ve got the most family heritage for mechanical comming from a bunch of car guys. Plus they get the best fiction representation. My dream job is Ouroboros from Loki but maybe that's just the set and props designers working.</p>

<p>I think civil gets to go outside the most. Engineers all talk about working at the desk but getting up to walk around the shop. Maybe if the shop is big enough you get a traveling adventure job. Maybe your shop is too big and you get stuck in one of those sad suburban offices miles away from your railroads. I do like roads, paths and cities but I’m not sure I love buildings and bridges. When I told my friend I was getting a degree in industrial he called it ironic because I hate industry.</p>
<p>That is true, most industry is unnecessary and evil, so is most civil scale development. I can’t get mad at tools, trinkets, and machines. The little things deserve some maintenance and respect even if the big system stuff can use a forest fire. Industrial engineering is just business school but real. The dream there is being the big boss and running it right like I’m playing Rimworld, Factorio, or Simcity. Alternatively I get stuck somewhere in the middle of a giant institutional mass playing the bad guys from marxism. If I want to go crank mode and live in a van by the river, mechanical makes me the artificer from D&D, industrial makes me a capital goon trying to start from scratch. My mechanical Grandfather can fix everything like a wizard. I asked the boss of industrial engineering at my school what domestic abilities she got. She said she got better at walking stuff around. I know she does big things but I’m not sure if big things are for me.</p>
<p>I got some computer skill just by being myself but I don’t want a desk job. I love electricity down to the watts and capacitors but unless I am some kind of powerline fixing vagabond, I don’t want a desk job. Big respect to the bioengineers but I’ve got medical heritage in my family too and they tell me to stay out of medicine. I’m okay with a deskish job like being a student where they let you roam around a little but I don’t want to get anchored in some dungeon.</p>
<p>So that’s my conflict otherwise I’ve been putting up big numbers at the school game. Living in a dorm is like living in a thoreau cabin but instead of self sufficiency and the woods it costs more than philly rent and there you’re living off the dinning hall. I would rather cook up my own food and generate my own electricity with a little hand crank because I have a low ass lifestyle requirement for some reason. Everybody is demanding some complex meals and churning through resources for no reason but I don’t get it. Living out of an institution means the little tasks (fixing the appliances, taking out the trash etc.) get taken by the machine of economies of scale and comparative advantage. Those two concepts always seem to suck the humanity out of everything.</p>
