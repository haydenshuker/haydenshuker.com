<h1>How I eat</h1>

<p>For medical reasons my diet has to be a bit unconventional. Fortunately it made me eat like Tom Brady heres what I do. I'll get numbers when I am living off campus, but my personal food cost must be so tiny.</p>
<p>I am willing to eat the food other people won't, and I don't need extravagence or varity.</p>
<h1>What I Eat</h1>
<p>Blood sugar will kill me so I avoid carbs. The only good low carb food that isn't something wird like mushrooms is meats. Thats about all I really can safely eat. I don't care about any other 'food stat' like salt, fat, the 'white vs. red' distinction or anything else. I can scan food labels for the carb count really fast, and nothing else. And I'm willing to eat any meat I'm not picky. Necks, hooves, liver, crickets, I don't care. I just go for the lowest prices.</p>
<h1>Cooking</h1>
<p>I hear people talking about 'learning to cook' as if there was a skill floor. I don't get the assumption that meals need to have sides and components. </p>
<h1>Choice</h1>
<p>You save money the closer you get to feeling like you're strait up eating a corpse. I think chicken breast is so popular partially because it's so geometric, simple and almost abstract that you can imagine away the factory farming death and horrors. Something with a lot of shape and bone like a cow neck is only really possible to eat if you get in there like a dog, but you can get really cheap cow necks.</p>
