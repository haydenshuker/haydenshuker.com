<h1>Essay #6: D&D Combat</h1>

<p>Recently I played the greatest role playing game conceivable by man. You've got to love it. I tried surfing once and I don’t want to do it again because surfing is mostly foating in the sun. If you don’t love that, you can’t surf. D&D is for people who love talking to nerds. You can only do much to polish away the talking and nerds, its for people who like talking to nerds. So someone says some pedantic rules whatever, you say that's wrong, they say look in the book, you do, it turns out that both of you were wrong, all of this has barely any bearing on who's winning because all of you are winning because this is what you came for. It’s floating in the sun.</p>
<p>Turn based strategy games feel so natural because that's how we conceptualize competition. I watched some Naruto, the end of the first season where they take 10 episodes to resolve this one fight on a foggy bridge. The fight is a back and forth of questions and resolutions, like tennis where it's an attack and remise until some series of moves is breaking. I remember seeing the ridiculous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Minnesota_Vikings_season#Week_10:_at_Buffalo_Bills">33–30 Vikings game</a> live. You don’t need to know much football for this to feel like a scripted dragonball fight. The more you understand the sport the more you see the move-countermove decision making aura floating around the field. If you don’t feel the strategy, it looks like a homogeneous slab of statistics cranking out another weighted die roll.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is just mindless, and the winner is the person who just has the better numbers. Here the story is somewhere else. Olympic track and field commentary is about the nuances and advantages in training and determination that these guys battle with over the span of their careers. Baseball is now thought of as an excel duel between GMs.</p>
<p>In fiction, these decisions and outcomes are for the author to sell. The Naruto bridge fight arc works like a board game, with the pieces pinned around the board and the characters pulling out cards to fizzle out each other’s moves. It's very explicit here, they literally explain every attack. In action with subtly, the same thing happens but they let it go implicitly. In a fight I don’t like, the authors and choreographers can't convey decisions. It feels like filler spectacle that accidentally relives narrative tension, “Roll for initiative.”</p>
<p>D&D combat is usually boring. You and your friends have a little activity to clean up, which is fun if you love talking to these guys. I think people are susceptible to thinking of D&D characters like Bloons Tower Defense monkeys who just process combat indefinitely using the law of large numbers except you need to process it 5 steps an hour. A capable DM can turn a fight into a Q&A duel, but understanding that is implicit knowledge not baked into the rule books or even community culture. You can win fights by posting up and regular-attacking every turn.</p>
<p>The rules don’t pose a new situation every turn. The situation stays ‘two guys in five feet slugging’. Greatest RPG ever <a href="https://evilhat.com/product/blades-in-the-dark/">Blades in the Dark</a> doesn’t do this because the whole game is made of changing situations. You shoot a guy and you open the ‘noise’ dial or ‘distance’ dial and you make your next move with different variables. In D&D you follow procedure until this shoe in fight is over like a sudoku puzzle. The fights start with an interesting engagement, and might end on a decision to run or die, but they have a big spongy middle neutral. Every fight feels like WWI. I don’t think D&D wants to tell that story.</p>
<p>I assume the way to make this style of game what I want is to cut the fluff. If you attack a guy ten times in a row, you’ve just attacked them once. Fortunately these long pauses in D&D combat give you time to imagine playing the game. The game is made of imagination so it's just as fun.</p>
