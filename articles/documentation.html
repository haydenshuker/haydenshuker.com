  <h1>Soft Standards</h1>
  <p>Web design as a feild has developed a set of design shortcuts. Every site has the title at the top, a set of links up there too, maybe a footer full of garbage. This is a counter to the fexibility of hypertext.</p>
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>Top level links: Top level links are the primary ones used to navigate. I think these are important to include just because they have become a strong convention.</p>
    <p>The Archive: This top level page contains every page in the site, sort of like a web map</p>
  
  <h1>Code Structure</h1>
  <p>I choose not to use HTML div elements. I would rather use the named content ones (main, article etc.) for self-documentation.</p>

  <h1>Bookmarks</h1>
  <p>Previously I have replaced entire links articles when I felt they 'no longer represented me'. I disagree with this method now. I think I was tyring to mainting no living documents, but the whole site is a living document by nauture so that is a wierd goal.</p>
  <p>Links are chosen as the most 'diveable'. I want rabbit holes that keep going so explorers can bounce through my site as a single conductive node.</p>
