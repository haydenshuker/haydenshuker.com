  <p>With the goal of making this site as readable and copyable as possible, as well as to create a reference for myself, here is my own process for building this website.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Get parts:
  <ul>
  <li>Get a domain name, I used godaddy for the sex appeal</li>
  <li>Make those static page files, I used W3schools to learn how</li>
  <li>Get a hosting service running. I used github pages because they are free, though there is a big technical skill barrier. I would otherwise recommend Neocities for my sort of goals.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Link your host to your domain guys. This part ususally involves private companies. Most of the internet is surprisingly private, lets try to change that.</li>
<li>Upload your site to your host.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Growing</h2>
<p>My method is not to upgrade anything untill why I have breaks. Starting out, I kept only one page which I posted whole blogs until that became too big for finding anything.</p>
<h2>Convention</h2>
</p><p>
<h2>Artistry</h2>
</p>I find graphical user interfaces artisticly unsatisfying. <p>
