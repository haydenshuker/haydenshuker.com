<h1>Blog #9: Various Ideas</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-3-12">March 12, 2024</p>
<p>I’m working on becoming a writer. Huzzah! Completion!</p>
<p>Thats not actually what I’m trying to do, if I’m really trying. I'm finding all the berries growing in my mind rather than leaving them there to overripen on the vines. I say I don’t know if I’m trying because I think I may just be following my whims like a cat would.</p>
<p>There was this computer program I used to use that was just a big bundle of index cards that you would write and link together into this complex web of all you would ever learn or think. I gave up on it when I stopped wanting to record everything I had ever known or thought about. Once the card is written it’s trivial, I already knew it. Even after months of playing with the cards, linking them, updating them it felt like busy work. Why would I make my own wikipedia? That's like pathological compulsive behavior. Memory alone is strong enough.</p>
<p>The program sucks, I’m good at making connections, I don't need to organize them. But there was a draw there, that was main. Writing the cards was valuable. I actually still do that, I write up all the course material before a test. I think writing is learning, I don’t think dicking around with meta data is as pure.</p>

<h2>What is writing?</h2>
<p>I have this problem where I do some activity, then I ask “but what is [this activity]?” The question kills my enthusiasm and I go do something else.</p>
<p>“What is writing?” It's playing in the abstraction box? Lining up all the abstract dominos and throwing them at our little brother? It's all made out of ideas. I do ideas thats what smart, white collar, education nerds are for. So then I owe it to my identity to crank out writing, that's ideas receipts. If I sit in neutral I’ll produce ideas but those wont do anything except maybe kick around my mind and drive me crazy. If I write them down now they’re going somewhere and they mean something to other people. The idea is severed and slopped out of my mind, don’t worry they always seem to grow back, now it's a piece of paper that I can throw at my little brother.</p>
<p>My left pocket has a notepad labeled “lipu tawa nanpa [nanpa] (portable paper number [number]).” Currently I’m up to notepad number six after about a year. Right pocket gets the pen, currently an imported fine tip pilot V-Pen (thanks mom). There isn’t much point trying to dive tackle every idea before it escapes me, they stay inhabiting the area. But I left the area. I go home and I open up the book and they are all cornered in my room and I put them on my website.</p>

<h2>My website</h2>
<p>20ish articles and counting, not bad. Musician Patricia Taxon says her real discography goes back maybe the last 15 albums but her total discography goes back like 60. The Pluralistic guy makes a sort of article compendium almost every day on top of publishing a bunch of journalistic works and novels. Masahiro Sakurai wrote a magazine column for a couple decades while he was making all those games. Any of the big guys, Mark Twain, Emerson, Kaffka, whoever wrote a shit load. I don’t even care about the training arc, practice makes perfect grindset angle. I don’t care about making masterpieces or warding off dementia or anything. I don’t do this for any defined reason at all.</p>
<p>My rival desire is not to flood my friends with spam. “Hey guys I did some physics problems today! I ran out of paper so I rescued an old one but it's okay because I used a pen instead of pencil. Sorry if that's hard to read, try turning your brightness down so you don’t see the pencil.” Next thing that happens is I’m out of trust, you all think I’m a hack and stop reading. But actually that isn’t a problem because I don’t have metrics enabled. If you lie to me about reading my blog I respect that you want to be soft on my feelings.</p>
<p>But a work is a work, who cares if it’s published. I’m going for quantity of memories here, not acclaim. Here's one, today while walking around I wrote:</p>
<p>“When the lights change at an intersection it feels like everybody involved is playing a hand of cards.”</p>
<p>There is nothing I can do about that, it is an interesting perspective, maybe I’ll create more trick taking game metaphors in the future. The sentence is technically a complete idea, even before getting typeset in beautiful serif. Another work completed!</p>

<h2>Solutions!</h2>
<p>What is engineering? The school says: "engineering is problem solving.” And you can’t already know the solution because that's just work and you can’t not understand the problem because that's science and you must have a solution or else that's media.</p>
<p>A solution is resolute, the puzzle is over, you can’t take the puzzle back apart it doesn't matter. You already know the nuances of the picture so it will be easy labor the second time. So puzzles are disposable but nature is basically just the new york times crossword 10 times over and you get new ones everyday.</p>
<p>I don’t like it when a company calls their products ‘solutions’. Nobody needed to ‘solve the problem’ the solution was obviously getting the guy to do it now they just do the work. I regularly shout ‘eurika’.</p>
<h2>Another Schuylkill trail</h2>
<p>A fixed gear bike has the petals and wheel locked together in motion like a kids tricycle. It's supposed to be a ‘purer machine’ with as simple a force path as possible between you and the ground. You’re supposed to set the two gears at a ratio of two primes so the tire doesn’t wear unevenly with the cadence of your petalling. You must petal to move, even if you need to mash up a hill, or whip twist your legs on the way back down. This is a stupid thing to do, don’t ride these stupid hipster bikes. However if you have the will and audacity to petal like that on a normal bike, you can go so damn far.</p>
<p>At home I rode my lil brother’s marlin. After coming back from these city bikes the thing felt like a dive bomber. Drop a ring and disappear and pick it back up to stay gone for good. Mountain biking honestly helps in Philadelphia these roads get dubious and these sidewalks are always dubious. I try to avoid the sidewalks to not run over hipsters and yuppies but this city is slacking on bike lanes. There's a nice continuous route on Girard Ave. by the park that ducked away from me and left me free balling on a highway type thing. Who the hell put a slip lane right through a bike lane?</p>
<p>Whenever I’m getting grumpy about technology or modernity or whatever I remember everything is mostly fine the only problem is the cars. That feels reductive but this city is so beautiful in the places it sucks to drive. Fairmont park is trying to turn itself into a meadow, 5 acres of it. The first five are the hardest. When economic conditions get cold, like the inevitable big one that's the next depression, the things that die first are going to be the frivolous extremities. Core Philly will stay as is but getting out into drive way country the tax revenue vs. infrastructure cost decision making kicks in and everybody saves a lot of money by turning the suburbs into the stuff in Detroit and Baltimore and letting it all grow over with moss and foxes.</p>

<h2>Futurism</h2>
<p>Solarpunk is a proper 21st century futurism. Ditch the 20th century dreams that went nowhere. The flying/self driving cars, space bullshit, jetpacks, all that aerospace stuff really. The sky is fragile and dangerous and basically empty. No more robots, humanoid or otherwise, nor cutesy automation. That was some housewife fantasy. We don't do that anymore. The strange end of physics isn’t cool anymore. No lasers or nuclear power, or nuclear war. Nuclear armageddon didn’t happen and it probably won't.</p>
<p>Tech goons have been stuck in the old fantasies that just don’t resonate anymore. They’ve been pushing that domestic convention dream reframed to take time back from strenuous workload rather than perpetual boomer leisure.</p>
<p>What's interesting about the future now is the land, not the sky. Nukes won’t fall and spaceships won’t fly to mars, but nobody knows if the plants will die, the concrete will bake or if it will all get flooded away. Armogenden is now global warming and ecological collapse which takes a whole lot more nuance. It's not fallout or star trek but a gradient of death count and sea level rise.</p>
<p>Convenience and consumerism got decadent and unsatisfying. The nuclear home was supposed to be this automated housewife disney land with the washing machine, fridge and robots. Apple and Google tapped into that, now its nine subscription services a month and bricked phones.</p>
<p>The new science hit fruition and stopped being an exciting source of hope. The nuclear reactor got supplanted by the old as dirt coal plant, cars stayed combustion and on the ground, it all gave us climate change and now there is plastic everywhere.
</p>
<p>My take is we make a massive growth withdrawal for the sake of efficiency. Everybody’s consumption gets cut significantly. Planes and cars become trains, the suburbs get pulled between condensing back into masonry cities or disbursing to proper rural villages. We keep our knowledge but without the dream progress will brush away our mistakes. So we keep 100 year old typewriters with hacked together computers with solar panels and bike generators. The buildings start looking like the Pilly historic district because we again care about heating energy and transportation time on foot. It's not some nostalgia trip, the past is gone, we will never think like that again or resolve those old situations. The constraints will stop being so loose but we won’t regress. Architects will push new styles, the old stuff and our modern stuff will get lumped into the ongoing conversation.</p>
