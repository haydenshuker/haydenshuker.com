<h1>Room Clean</h1>

<p>I cleaned my room. Not an impressive activity but most aren't. I’ve got a whole month to post. Not everyday can be an excursion.</p>
<p>This isn’t an epic moment from a domestic perspective ether. I just took this room from fine to good. If I mopped too that could have been something.</p>
<p>Anyway I’ve been thinking about the room as a shrine. Literally and religiously. I drew this hex sign to ward off evil from my website.</p>

<p>I’m okay with other places having more evil than this room. It proves at least that I’ve done something here. Everyone’s finite power and responsibility and all. I need to find some quality charms and artifacts. No dubious ones sent again by treacherous demons. Engineers have a tendency to take soul damage. I believe this is because WD40 dissolves aether. In any case I must take proper precautions.</p>
<p>I have this tendency to fall into overly formal commercial habits. That's the engineer brain. For example, I keep a set of yearly journals dating back to middle school. They came with spine labels which I used as a library would with years, descriptions, and even myself written in as the author. My ugly handwriting was screaming at me. I don’t need that level of formal archival. These books grew from my body like hair. I know each one in fine temporal detail. These things were my life back in each of their times. So I removed the labels. Now the shelf is a nice series of colors like a weird washed out flag pride flag.</p>
