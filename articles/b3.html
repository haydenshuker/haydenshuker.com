<h1>Blog #3: Business Elixir</h1>

<p>I'm changing my major! I entered undecided because true wisdom is understanding one's ignorance. But then I rushed into industrial because indecision is dishonorable. I think I chose it at the time because it had a little 'business' to it which is a magical and cursed elixir easy to fall victim to. Business elixir makes wealth feel like a matter of virtue and cunning, like you could meaningfully grow a pile of money just by spending it well. The truth is wealth is a matter of power and social structure that no degree can crack. The hard cap for the middle class is dentist type niche skill money, the second-to-top of the bureaucratic corporate ladder where title becomes obviously unequal to real entrenched ownership, and the kind of false ownership of the little companies the the system would let a recession wash away. Then the top of the middle class stew at this surface hoping to evaporate into the realm of real owners, to displace an heir for one of the few slots for regional and national oligarchs. From the bottom to the McMansion class, business elixir exists to trick the hopeful into thinking their allegiance to the institutions and paraphernalia of capital will let them bubble off the top surface of the system's losers.
</p>
<p>The Temple industrial engineering students are in deep on business elixir. They think they don't need to study like the other disciplines because if they stand close enough to the white collar finance and management dream-vortex they'll get sucked to the top. Really the luckiest top of the working class get swamped in the flavors of management and finance whether they try to or not. The power structure exists, its worship by the business-elixired is irrelevant.
</p>
<p>Thus I don't need industrial engineering for success. If you're good they buy you a MBA anyway. If I'm at best going to be a skill monkey, I'll take the most fun skills or the ones I could escape back to the jungle with. Civil engineers seem to get to go outside the most. If I hate or don't make the engineering life I'll take my soil and surveying skill to become the most overly educated park ranger and maybe Thoreau it up a little bit. That life certainly beats all the wack ass flow charts that come up when you google 'systems engineering'.
