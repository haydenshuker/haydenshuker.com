<h1>Blog #6: Complete Redesign</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-01-13">January 13, 2024</p>
<p>Initially I threw my website up as quickly as possible by basing the design on the Gemini protocol, a sort of mini internet where every page is not much more than a hyperlinked text file. They are redended here in a raw but colorful way that I find kind of cute. Eventually though I got a dozen posts on a single scrollable tik tok like page so I needed an overhaul. I broke it up and rearranged everything creating the sort of inverse problem of having unmanageable amounts of text in too many places. My old single page was perfect in terms of ‘write once, read everywhere else’ if there was only one big clunky way to read it. Distributing it all out is less than perfect but I accept that problem because compromising on clunkiness lets me sleep at night.</p>
<p>While I was at it I got sucked into redoing the graphic design stuff. My rule is restraint, like leaning back while sprinting down a hill. If I can keep the organization scheme as basic as possible I’m happy. Does the page still look good if I turn off all the graphics? Then I play golf with the code until it’s satisfying (I don’t like &ltdiv&gt). I break everything down into stock standards. Does a regular browser run this without asking questions? I don’t like to name much of my own stuff because technical language is a harder puzzle than computers. The web comes with six layers of heading, the cute internet gemini has three, I feel weary using more than two. But I’m doing this all publicly. I must prove to the world I am well mannered enough to have a legible website.</p>
<p>I created a new archive page to list all my now separated old articles. It’s a bit less cozy without them all together, but the archive is a fine reunion. Taking a step back from the wall of text makes my modest post history a little more legible and impressive. I’ve got a set of shelved projects that were supposed to make it on here but all got stumped by something. The essays are usually the product of a saga of text files false starting on resolving the ideas that have been nagging at me. I was a huge computer keyboard hater until I wrote that essay about them. There are no analytics on this page primarily because I don’t want them. I can confirm the important readers myself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I haven’t yet developed a satisfying portfolio. I can trust that it will grow out of my works when constellations start to form. One of my top documents on the website right now is called ‘software I recommend’. After hours of cramming the site together I read it with hazy vision as just ‘software’ displayed under my name. I imagine having a library of programs, maybe small things like my writing here. Programmers like to get proud of being above tools like Python (the slow but easy programming language). It has its place though. On the surface its code can grow fast like a meadow but underneath parts may have to get rewritten in the harder programming languages as the work and author develop. Part of the reason I do this all by hand is to watch that process. This website developed like a summary of the first few years of the internet. I wouldn’t inflict the development labor I did for this on a non-enthusiast. I wonder if there is a wide scale way for people to understand computers on a simpler level.</p>
<p>I’ve long since broken and deleted my computer’s login menu, it opens to a blinking cursor on pitch black. I can type the command to enter my cleaned up interface, or I could stay in the past with the pixely text. You can do about all the non sensory things a computer can do there. So unless you’re looking to paint, or see your emails in the light of day, it’s a connection strait between the computer and your brain skipping most of your ears and eyes. Why engaging with the machine like this is worthwhile I don’t currently understand.</p>
<p>As a kid, one of my phases/autistic fixations has been the computer terminal; as in the box you type into for it to talk back. I would go on DOS emulators just to try to move around in the menus. I drew a 6th grade profile picture of a command prompt. I created a sort of choose your own adventure game out of IOS keyboard shortcuts. I remember playing with the apple terminal in middle school, but the black on white was was somehow less exciting than the white on black on microsoft. All this before my mom gifted me this laptop in the 8th grade. That age range is a natural lull in curiosity, but thankfully windows 11 ran like garbage and I got help installing arch linux. At this point the way I use my computer in those spaces between a given task (typing, internet browsing etc.) are strung together by my childhood terminal.</p>
<p>The Commodore 64 fascinates me. It opens even more directly than my computer it drops you right into programming. The modern terminal like what I’ve got is the next level up, you’re telling the computer commands to run prewritten programs. On the commodore 64, you would just write the programs. Part of what makes hand making a website challenging, is the standards of what a website is have been set by specialist professionals and corporations. In my opinion websites are still easier than modern apps and programs which are hidden from understanding with mountains of abstraction. On the Commodore 64, none of those standards have been developed yet. You and the BASIC programming language, the spiritual predecessor to python, were enough to create a utility and experience with the machine.</p>
