<h1>My Computer</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-04-22">March 22, 2024</p>
<p>I got some new (used) computer parts including two monitors, a mouse and a mysterious box. Thank you to my friend for the computer parts. Here is a technical overview.</p>
<img src="images/computer-diagram.jpg" alt="Crude diagram of my personal computer set up as described by this article">
<p>Pico :) is my laptop. Called as such becuase its small and I've done lots of science with it.</p>
<p>The mysterious box is a thunderbolt hub, its like the spine of this thing. It connects power, IO, but even the monitors to my laptop from a single cable.My roommate does a simmiler thing, pluging a buch of paripherials into his laptop, except he dosn't have a mysterious box so he needs to unplug everything everytime which is bad for escaping building fires.</p>
<p>For monitors, I like just using one becuase I think that looks cute. But I got two identical monitors, they are like brothers I want to use both of them but right now I only have the one HDMI cable.</p>
<p>I have a temptation to prove I'm better than a built up computer by keeping only a tiny laptop. Don't do that to yourself, the ergonomics are so bad. Doing all my schoolwork crammped over a laptop and desk last messed with my spine. If your computer hurts, it wont make you use the computer less, it will just hurt. Get some external peripherials.</p>
<p>I try to keep my power consumption down for the sake of honor. A space heater requires about a kilowatt and a phone less than 10. My computer is light enough it about matches a single monitor at full tilt. I would Imagine normal consumption for most of my use takes less than 100W.</p>
<p>I have since <a href="articles/b12.html">upgraded</a> my computer</p>
