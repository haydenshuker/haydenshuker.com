<h1>Links Archive #1: Artists and Works That Inspire Me</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-01-05">January 5, 2024</p>
</header>
<p>In loyalty to chronological order I'm moving the old links page here to let them sink with the past.</p>
<div class = "indent">
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW6lg-7L7yk">Well There's Your Problem</a>: It's a political, engineering disasters podcast based in Philly. Its nice to hear some complaining about engineering rather than more of the same ‘triumph of man, caretakers of enlightened society’ rhetoric. This is the best episode because they cover some funny disasters; the runner-up in that respect is the Hindenburg Episode. Its cathartic to hear them tear apart all the dumb buildings that my education has been rubbing in my face since childhood.</p>
<p><a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a>: Typography tutorial. I think it’s beautiful. Shoutout Practical Typography for every em-dash on this website.</p>
<p><a href="https://fontsinuse.com/">Fonts In Use</a>: Typography and graphic design examples. Pairs well with Practical Typography.</p>
<p><a href="https://ledergames.com/products/oath-chronicles-of-empire-exile">Oath</a>: Its a big ass board game that gets very emergent. I like how it trusts its system to make a story with minimal lore, primer or flavor text. The art is so full of character, every card is pfp material. It’s creation expresses a profound vision on what a game can be. No I've never played it.</p>
</div>

<p>I think my mind is a series of informal essays</p>
<div class = "indent">
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Patricia_Taxxon/videos">Patricia Taxxon</a>: Electronic musition and video essayist. Her songs are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avr6FG70BnQ">weird</a>. She talks about art, autism and 'furry degeneracy' its pretty fun. Be warned if you thing that stuff is nasty but like litteraly who cares.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JacobGeller">Jacob Geller</a>: The rare game video essayist who can synthesize some real takes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cjthex">CJ the X</a>: Video essayist who talks about art philosophy. The premiere fast talker. Patricia Taxxon imitated their style once which was an absolute stimulus blast.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HBMmaster">Jan Misali</a>: Eclectic nerd thinking video essayist. I like the light-on-dark serif text.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgh8Gfs2S7M">The Anthopocence Reviewed, John Green</a>: A sappy essay series I wish to emulate</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson#External_links">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>: My middle name was homework.</p>
</div>

<p>My stance on computers and the use of technology:</p>
<div class = "indent">
<p><a href=https://ploum.net/>Ploum</a>: Blog by a french hipster complains about the internet.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Model_100">The TRS-80 Model 100</a>: I could imagine this thing would be more comfortable to write on than a clamshell laptop.</p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Radio_Shack_TRS-80_Model_100.jpg/330px-Radio_Shack_TRS-80_Model_100.jpg" alt="TRS-80 Model 100"> 
<p><a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/">Gemini</a>: Its an the internet but deliberately limited for hipsters. Browsing these websites is a fun artistic and philosophical experience, however the only people who use this are dweebs who only want to talk about hipster computing, so it’s all just boring prose. It serves no practical use because you can just make a good website with regular internet tools, but I did base this website on the limitations of Gemini pages. Its value is mostly something to point to rather than something to actually use.</p>
<p><a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low Tech Magazine</a>: Neo-Luddite type articles. I like how they do images.</p>
<p><a href="https://iffybooks.net/">Iffy Books</a>: Hipster computing book store in Philadelphia.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Here are some things too mainstream to be interesting to include.</i></p>
<div class = "indent">
<p><a href="https://johnstoniatexts.x10host.com/kafka/beforethelawhtml.html">Before the Law, Franz Kafka</a>: Haunting short story.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.daysofwonder.com/memoir-44-universe/memoir-44/">Memoir 44</a>: Boardgame. A tactical WWII duel powered by random card hands. Turns might be a little too random but a better player mulched me five times in a row. I think <a href="https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/undaunted-normandy-9781472834706/">Undaunted</a> might do this concept a little better with some tight deck building but I've never played that one.</p>
