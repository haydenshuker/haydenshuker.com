<h1>Trolleys of Berks County</h1>
<p>"No one line in Berks County is best remembered for reasons of construction or size or speed. All were of the average, work-a-day type, furnished just transportation." Included in a pocket in the back cover is a reconstructed map of the trolley lines from various sources. My branch would have been the south western, which flows out to a tight box labeled Shillington and on to the creek village of Mohnton. Now that box ignores more of the suburban same though Kenhorst, Grill, Cumru, plus the exurban drone that replaced any berks hinterland. Harry Foesig is no archivalist. "tracing these old runs, one is struck by the beauty and scenic variety of the "unimproved" areas where they remain but shocked by the mounting, sprawling shopping center h o r r o r s." Less than perfect typesetting gives the historiography more of a bite then maybe the author intended.</p>
