<p>My physics 1 teacher didn't assign a textbook because he was teaching physics that hasn't changed for literally hundreds of years. With most courses like that, probably about all until undergrad junior year level, knowledge is cheap.</p>
<p>In terms of schools, about all the matters is being <a href='https://www.abet.org/accreditation/'>ABET accredited</a>,they are the Illuminati NGO behind engineering education that makes all our classes standardized and keeps our thinking conservative and docile. Schools without accreditation are considered cranks and scammers.</p>
<p>The least precarious workers don't form unions they uphold and glorify a standard of professionalism to turns their ranks into rare esoteric guildsman. For engineers its the <a href='https://www.nspe.org/'>National Society of Professional Engineers</a> with their PE exam, which is preceded by the FE exam which you take right out of collage. Being a PE gives you 'the stamp' which lets you sign your engineering documents into legal contracts so they can sue your ass if your thing breaks. Most mechanical engineers don't get them, its more a civil engineering thing.</p>

<h2>The statics solids dynamics series</h2>
<p>The core of engineering curriculum (for civil and mechanical I don't know what the other guys are up to) goes:
<ul>
<li>Statics: the force loads on an object</li>
<li>Solids (mechanics of materials): how loads on an object strain and deform that object</li>
<li>Dynamics: how loads on a object more an object</li>
</ul>
This is like the organic chemistry series that biologists take. Its the theoretical justification for our field.

<h2>"Engineering Economics"</h2>
<p><time datetime='2025-03-24'>March 24th 2025</p>
<p>The curriculum requires a course called 'engineering economics' which isn't economics its just finance. Its unprofound, inherently ideological, and generally easy.</p>
<p>The core of finance is the time value of money, capital's desire to grow itself. Money can't be directly compared across time (there is no $20 plus $40 tomorrow) because capital demands some rate of profit in between, be that in profitable sales and growth, or the abstracted equivalent to growth in interest/appreciation rates from bonds, assets etc.</p>
<p>So what makes finance math different from other math is the interest rates between time steps. This is done with the following excel functions:
<ul>
<li>FV</li>
<li>PV</li>
<li>NPV</li>
<li>RATE</li>
<li>PAYMENT</li>
</lu>
Research those 5 and you can roll your money around.</p>
<p>I'm not being reductionist or joking, the class is that simple.</p>
