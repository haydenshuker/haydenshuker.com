<h1>Essay #5: Brief Uninformed Tour of Math</h1>

<p>Mathematics is a formal science meaning it's best done wearing a tie. I don't know math. Here are the subdivisions of math courtesy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h2>Number theory</h2>
<p>Counting is really intuitive and it feels like it should just happen. Counting generates numbers but what's weird is just the set of numbers alone has properties within it? Like primes are just a fact of numbers, you can never have countable anything without it occasionally being indivisible. Numbers are not this flat homogeneous expanse but each one has uniqueness and together they form layers and textures. Number theory includes the pocket calculator arithmetic operations plus the other advanced calculator arithmetic operations because number theory is promoted arithmetic.</p>
<h2>Geometry</h2>
<p>"Points are items in a set called 'space' which is defined to exist axiomatically." As the numbers form a space of latent meaning, space forms a space of latent meaning. You know what geometry is.</p>
<h2>Algebra</h2>
<p>If you get bored of arithmetic you can do algebra which is the abstraction/automation of arithmetic for when you don't really care about the numbers because you would rather just play around with their manipulations. When you get bored of this too you can do it again and make the abstraction/automation of algebra: abstract algebra. Here the numbers are not the main characters but interchangeable vibes that sometimes cystalize back to reality.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>As arithmetic promotes to number theory, calculus promotes to analysis. Math becomes curvy and Calastrova here. Where number theoryâ€™s rational numbers form textures, analysis paves that space with infinitesimal irrationals turning the numbers to a flat plane where the functions can fly around.</p>
<h2>Discrete math</h2>
<p>Numbers are a continuous rolling landscape of complexities and intricacies, thats not a good environment for models. In discrete math you have a toy box of logical marbles and action figures that you can bash together in ways you define yourself. Here is where the fields that feel like math in their formality but don't take place in a cozy 'numeral space' take place like game theory, combinatorics and a lot of computer science.</p>
<h2>Logic</h2>
<p>Logic is where math becomes philosophy because they repoed logic from philosophy. All of math are these abstract platonic form things that can make sense in isolation, but form mind breaking structures when combined into a huge rules ecosystem. Logic keeps the whole thing from falling apart, but it also creates another space to be played with like the others.</p>
