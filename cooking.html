<h1>Cooking</h1>
<p>There is no 'learn to cook'. If you can use a microwave you're already cooking. The hitch people get is thinking meals need to be elaborate. Make one thing, stock pile leftovers and don't worry about sides or courses. I cook next to everything I eat when I'm at school, nearly always a single meat cooked a single way.</p>

<h2>cooking for others</h2>
<p>Making food for people feels amazing. Ingredients are so cheap they're basically free and recipes scale so easily. The generosity is just letting people in.</p>

<h2>how I cook</h2>
<p>The general idea of this section is the flexibility of food. 'knowing how to cook' could mean recipes that are two sentences to you.</p>
<p>eggs and omelettes: cook it on low and don't flip it so the inside stays runny. Pre-stir scrambled eggs and do so until your hand starts to hurt. Try to aerate them with big bubbles.</p>
<p>bacon and lard: I like bacon floppy. I don't buy much butter or oil because I keep the lard. Lard will keep long enough that you don't need to worry about it and makes everything taste a bit better. Bacon then eggs leaves too much lard so decant it into the lard bowel and use just what is left stuck to the pan</p>

<p>coffee:
<ol>
<li>Ground beans go stale so grind you own at time of brewing. Good grinders use burrs bad grinders use blades.</li>
<li>Heat water to less than a rapid boil. Use the pour to agitate and suspend the grounds.</li>
<li>I use a french press, it keeps it thick and oily. I time for 4 minutes.</li>
<li>I use too much heavy cream and I will do so until god revokes dairy from me.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Meat: I try to cook as raw as I can without salmonella.
<ul>
<li>Chicken thighs are the cheapest. They bake easy. Best marinaded and grilled. I save pickle juice for this.</li>
<li> Pork chops unless overcooked can be steak level delicious for me. Apple cider vinegar in the fry.</li>
<li>Ribs: thick paprika rub. I don't worry about off the bone I'll rip it off like a dog.</li>
<li>Sausage: low and slow</li>
<li>Ring baloney: can be cut and fired if you want to eat something salty and weird.</li>
</ul>
