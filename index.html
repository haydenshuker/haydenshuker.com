	  				<h1>Update #1 The Website Broke</h1>
	  				<p><time datetime="2023-11-19">November 19, 2023</time></p>
	  				<p>My website was down for the last couple weeks. That’s because I’m hosting this using google’s firebase. My website is maybe 20kb total but google is trying to sell you some kind of entrepreneur, web-app, internet-storefront-platform dream that hasn’t been cool since maybe the Obama administration. I will bite the hell out of the hand that feeds me even if they are feeding me for free by letting me latch my 20kb to their eldritch horror of a service unnoticed.</p>
					<p>The real dream is self hosting, If the cloud is someone else’s computer I want to use my own, preferably a cute rack mounted thing I buy off temple university IT department for under 50$. If the only way to make money is to sell labor, of course google is going to try to sell me more labor then I want by pushing a million little bloated services to do with their giant computers. If I exert only the labor I need myself the whole thing takes less work and it comes out more virtuous anyway because true virtue uses minimal effort.</p>
					<p>I use a bit of a private definition of ‘virtue’ here, I really just mean ‘good’. And I use ‘good’ in the general way that the philosophers like to try to define. It can be what every axis of quality you want to use because they are all secretly the same thing in a giant dialectic, efficiency is beauty is practicality is coolness is virtue. Thus my website is better than google because their hosting is bloated and unstable and my website loads quick and doesn’t release that much CO₂.</p>

	  				<h1>The Library Of Craigslist</h1>
	  				<p><time datetime="2023-11-11">November 11, 2023</time></p>
	  			</header>
	  			<p>Some durable goods, even mass-produced ones, take in the shape of the their user’s soul like a sole takes the shape of the foot. The obvious examples are the items easily called artworks, the sketchbooks and patched up jackets of all disciplines. Thus the inverse is true, an item that can’t be customized forms to no soul. To the most extreme end of this side of the spectrum of possessions is the deliberately fungible cash, next come the houses and stock cars, everything bought to be resold. These commodity items aren't metaphysically connected to their owner, their ownership is more like a hoard of withdraws from the library of Craigslist.</p>
	  			<p>A car looses value if it’s modified, even if those modifications improve the quality of the car. Houses notoriously became that homogeneous gray-beige for the sake of resale-value. Generally, if the full rights of ownership are utilized, one is punished with a decrease in its worth. You can do more with a library book than one you want to resell, you could read it in the bath or take it to the beach because its damaged value is shared by the society. </p>
	  			<p>To get maximal use out of a commodity, one must be the last in the series of owners who finally chooses to nuke the resale value and fully smash their soul into the items surface. This creates an awkward middle ground when an item that doesn’t get adopted as a personality piece, nor ran back-into-the dust-from-whence-it-came, but also can’t be resold for a reasonable price worth the effort of selling. These items that are still full of utility get lost in the limbo of marginal value. Over-production fueled store shelves make the used things unfairly worthless to the market. These things get discarded before their lifespan is over, go to thrift stores or get hoarded. In each case, the buyer is punished by getting fractional value of a good they paid full price for.</p>
	  			<p>Then to abandon the difficultly of moving items though the competitive, labor intensive, pain in the ass that is the market, items may be bought and owned collectively to ensure maximum durability expenditure from each item. Anybody could pay into access a pool of stuff, and borrow anything not worth owning but still worth using. They are expected to reasonably return an item while only consuming a fair share of durability, and may be held accountable by getting collection access revoked if they don't. This is obviously just the library redescribed from first principles. I’m in a library right now, I wouldn’t pay for all these books, rooms, and computers, but I would pay a tiny fraction of their combined value to suck a little bit of durability out of a lot of them. </p>
	  			<p>I dream that one day they could have stand mixers, lawnmowers, basketballs, bicycles, vans, boardgames, kilns, and rifles all in here along side the books and the computers. The librarians seem to know this, they are all filling out their library-of-things collections. Still, they have lots of chairs, cozy isles of books and many conference rooms not used after hours. They could let a somebody stay the night if they obey the same rules as checking out a book. The inefficiency under current practice frustrates me.</p>

		 			<h1>Blog #2: Thoreau is Awesome</h1>
		 			<p><time datetime="2023-11-2">November 2, 2023</time></p>
		 		</header>
		 		<p>I like how Thoreau gets a little retroactively canceled sometimes just for being an asshole. He was uniquely immune to giving a shit about anybody, and would extend all his petty problems with people into complete misanthropy. He’s a natural born hater and ironically kind of disconnected from reality, but that’s just what makes him a fun writer. </p>
		 		<p>Human sized space fits well into 15' by 10' Walden cabins. The lounge I’m in could probably fit about four totally self sufficient proto-liberatarians with rich transcendentalist friends. The logical weakness Thoreau never picks up on, is that he could feed himself, do philosophy, and not need any society because his pencil factory dad sent him to Harvard and better transcendentalist Emerson let him borrow his freshly plundered native American land. Libertarianism works great if you can contrive a way to be left alone, but in real life you don't get left alone and not everybody gets to hide in the woods.</p>
		 		<p>I like to think about his gross neck beard when he’s talking about other people’s poverty, but when he talks about his own poverty he’s uniquely profound. I love the parts of Walden where he just tabulates his stuff, like the materials that went into his house, his total labor to clean, or where he gets his food. It’s like caveman level literature and a true triumph of autistic art. Looser self help writers get abstract fast, but Thoreau will tell you true free thinkers eat nothing but raw corn meal and own less than one bucket.</p>
		 		<p>Thoreau makes me want to keep all my school papers in a pile in case I need to burn them it for warmth, or power my laptop and light bulbs on a 9-watt solar panel. He makes me look at two chairs and think ‘that’s too many chairs’. He makes me uncomfortably aware of waste. The lobby for the ugly Temple architecture school could probably fit the livelihoods of a few dozen bean men. Free thinkers can get free things off the streets because the masses buy more glasses and drawers than they need. Nobody needs to spend that much on furniture if they’re cool with making rickety furniture. </p>
		 		<p>In conclusion minimalism is fun but most minimalists are full of shit.</p>

	  			<h1>Blog #1: Why I Made This Website</h1>
		  		<p><time datetime="2023-10-23">October 23, 2023</time></p>
	  		</header>
	  		<p>Making this website was easy but only for a person like me. I grew up poking around on the computer and making games and stuff. I could figure out what buttons to push on go daddy dot com because I've developed a subconscious sense for the weird ways a computer wants to work. I'm not free from the the mainstream social media sites either. I could evangelize federated media, or tiny blogs or whatever but the truth is the only people who use those things are the nerds like me who want to deal with stuff like that. I've read too many posts about the free internet open foss libre whatever. Really I want to watch the comedian, video essayist, artists on youtube or read the memes made by people with something more to say than their computer IT skills. The job here has a technical gate but this is really media and prose and art. </p>
	  		<p>That being said, damn this free and open shit is awesome. My brother said my site loads instantly and fits his dinky phone perfectly. People love real minimalism when you give it to them. I give it to myself all the time. My computer runs like hot garbage. The bluetooth doesn't work, sometimes an update will become a mess, I'm not entirely sure how to connect to wifi without looking it up on the internet which can become a problem. Free and open is not as hard as I make it, I kind of love living in this leaky roofed house, but I'm a weird person who ether likes computer problems, or I’m willing to give up on the computer if I don't want to solve them. Its like those guys with the Honda civics with the AC taken out, the dream is to go fast enough with the windows down that the heat isn't a big deal. I say I don't like computers sometimes but I do like computers. I don't like the companies and their big dumb programs but that's not the fault of the nor-gates or the directory trees. I like all the raw basic tools, like the terminal, HTML, hammers, swords, bicycles, tongs. Using these tools are like the free-wights, they train the little muscles that the machines don't, and there is something more fun about balancing a dumbbell rather than pulling a bolted in lever.</p>
	  		<p>Then there's the media aspect. I wouldn't call myself an artist but I would say everyone is innately an artist. I like writing essays and jokes and poems, and I think I should be talking at least as loud as some of these other idiots on the internet. The music I’m making at the moment ranges from trite to clearly incompetent. I'm not the kind of person who could crank out works all alone for no audience. I think the people who can go on to become outsider art legends but personally I prefer the social aspect too. Its hard to release, especially if you're like me and you have a violent distrust of social media but no website. Now I have a website, so I can release, and I get to be an artist more.</p>
