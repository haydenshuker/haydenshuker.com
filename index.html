<p>A website describing the moon can never be the moon so feel free to message me. My art stuff I especially intend on keeping local and peer-to-peer. We know mass public social media failed everyone (see the dark forest analogy— you, your boss, aunt, partner and every intelligence agency in the same room crushes human dignity) and the personal website isn’t better.</p>
<p>This site itself is a long running personal project. Everything is static, made by hand in HTML and CSS, with no javascript cookies, trackers or anything like that. I don’t use LLMs, and I intend on circumventing the monopolistic internet when able.</p>

<h2>casual resume</h2>
<p>See my formal linkedin for details; if you want my numbers know they are really high. I go to Temple for civil engineering because I love the physical material world (among other things) and through doing this I can hopefully do some work to better it though concrete, dirt and water. I write, and they elected me e-board at Temple Debate Society, so my horizon looks like developing and merging logical technical thinking with fuzzy communicative thinking to become an engineering manager or to connect my work to public policy.</p>
<p>Additionally I like computers! I write this on my arch linux duel boot and as stated, I programmed all this. I chose against CS because I also like going outside and pointing at things with my clipboard.</p>
