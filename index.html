<p>When you google me, the things that come up are: my accounts on the big social media sites that pay for SEO, my name on my grandmotherâ€™s obituary, my wage as a summer camp councilor in high school (nine dollars an hour), and a local news paper article announcing my win at a high school trivia competition (it was badass).</p>
<p>I am currently a full time mechanical engineering student at Philadelphia's Temple University.</p>
<p>All code here is artisanally handcrafted. This site has no analytics, spyware, javascript, cookies or anything like that. If you want to tell me to kill myself please reach me by SMS or instagram (I apologize, I will get around to making a proper email some day). Please make your own website. It doesn't even need to be good.</p>
