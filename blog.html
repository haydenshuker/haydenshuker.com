<p>You can't do a good job at a bad job. I knew hardwork, she beat the shit out of me. If I worked as hard as I don't, I would live a crazy life. The worst jobs let you get away with three hours of sleep. I think some people like being told what to do. Recently I weedwacked a barbed wire fence, and mowed the underside of the bleachers. My time was so wasted I'm its designated driver.</p>
<p>A reoccoring theme with me (I) here (<a href="https://haydenshuker.com">haydenshuker.com</a>) is withdrawing, quitting and bailing. Its like I'm runnng through the forest with no guidence other than dubious erie figures hidden among the braches who chase me from the fog. "Follow your genius" they say as if my genius was conspicuous. Plus I've got all these figures on me.</p>

<p>I wrote about <a href="articles/b11.html">Public Writing</a>.</p>
<p>I also wrote about <a href="articles/b12.html">My Computer Again</a>.</p>
<p>This summer, I'm trying to rot a little less by letting myself engage with my hobbies in the lowest and least valuble ways. Like during lent I got off youtube partially by not beating myself up for switching to a lesser vice (Bloons Tower Defence). I would rather write slowly and unprofound niche hobbist articles than scroll instagram.</p>

<p>Outdoor, manual, wake up at 5am labor. I'll probably need a bigger hat. I've got a friend who works landscaping and he says its what made him musculer. This could be huge.</p>

<p>I want my life to look like this, the white walls and industrial finishes flushed with green. Its a room of cold, dead machines tending to plants too alive to fit the space. On the other end I imagine that botanist honing in the timing for the sprinkler system as if it kept themself alive. I felt that authorship.</p>

<p>I aced the test! I am now certified in expencive french CAD software. Passing the solidworks test means getting 80/120 for both parts. I got 120 twice.

<h1>Open Game Development!</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-4-10">April 10, 2024</p>
  <p>After game engine unity screwed everybody, it looks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDFltgjLtE&themeRefresh=1">Slay the Spire 2</a> Will be the first big-deal game made with open source engine <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>. Maybe this shifts the needle on an entire software category; who knows. It's a good deal for everyone. The game studios don't need to deal with unity, so they get more money so they have less of a need to screw us over. Unity dies, but they're assholes so nobody gives a shit. The question then is who pays for the maintenance of Godot? Ideally the studios but that puts them all in a giant prisoner's dilemma. Then really ideally the state pays for it, but not really because making things is super cheap when all the workers are doing it for the common good and there are no middlemen or rent-seekers to pay. If godot gets captured and privatized into being a new Unity, we can expect them to get decadent and die too.</p>
  <p>I would like to then also shout out <a href="https://motiontwin.com/">Motion Twin</a>, the creators of Dead Cells for running for over two decades as a worker's co-op. I love france.</p>

<h1>Update #9: Lenten Progress</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-3-1">March 1, 2024</time></p>
<p>I had a conversation with Jesus and he told me everybody in college needs instagram because that's where everybody talks. So we came to the agreement that I can use it only for messaging. To prove I’m serious I’m giving up podcasts too.</p>
<p>Lent is working for me. I’ve actually got more time. I’m working on a role playing game project. I’ll try to get the little minimum prototype out by the end of break (I’m saying this publicly so my pedantic friend who reads this keeps me accountable). Then I will abandon it forever.</p>
