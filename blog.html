<p>When you google me, the things that come up are: my accounts on the big social media sites that pay for SEO, my name on my grandmother’s obituary, my wage as a summer camp counselor in high school (nine dollars an hour), and a local newspaper article announcing my win at a high school trivia competition (it was badass).</p>
<p>I am currently a full time mechanical engineering student at Philadelphia's Temple University.</p>
<p>All code here is artisanally handcrafted. This site has no analytics, spyware, javascript, cookies or anything like that. If you want to tell me to kill myself please reach me by SMS or instagram (I apologize, I will get around to making a proper email some day). Please make your own website. It doesn't even need to be good.</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that my blog/essay distinction is meaningless because as a blog these are all blogs. Sorry about that. I'm keeping the numbering though just for my own amusement. I haven't been working on that RPG thing I promised so expect some rushed slop.</p>

<h1>Update #9: Lenten Progress</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-3-1">March 1, 2024</time></p>
<p>I had a conversation with Jesus and he told me everybody in college needs instagram because that's where everybody talks. So we came to the agreement that I can use it only for messaging. To prove I’m serious I’m giving up podcasts too.</p>
<p>Lent is working for me. I’ve actually got more time. I’m working on a role playing game project. I’ll try to get the little minimum prototype out by the end of break (I’m saying this publicly so my pedantic friend who reads this keeps me accountable). Then I will abandon it forever.</p>

<p>Less than half a week into lent and I’m off youtube in favor of wikipeda. It’s like I’m making dumb internet content just for myself. This isn't much better.</p>

<h1>Update #8: Lenten Sacrifice</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-2-16">Febuary 16, 2024</time></p>
<p>This Lent I’m giving up instagram, reddit, youtube and grain foods. Apologies to Jesus for not getting this out quicker. Dare I say devil do not tempt me! If you message me on instagram I will NOT reply.</p>

<p><a href="articles/e4p1-webdesign-notes.html">Essay #4 Web Design Notes</a></p>
<p>I wrote this complaint about bloated web design for the temple race car club marketing department. I want to publish it properly but it still feels unfinished. I've authored it as a dangling part one to represent that.</p>
<p>I feel a sort of kinship with this guy.</p>
