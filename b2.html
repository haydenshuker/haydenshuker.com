<h1>Blog #2: Thoreau is Awesome</h1>

<p>I like how Thoreau gets a little retroactively canceled sometimes just for being an asshole. He was uniquely immune to giving a shit about anybody, and would extend all his petty problems with people into complete misanthropy. He’s a natural born hater and ironically kind of disconnected from reality, but that’s just what makes him a fun writer. </p>
<p>Human sized space fits well into 15' by 10' Walden cabins. The lounge I’m in could probably fit about four totally self sufficient proto-liberatarians with rich transcendentalist friends. The logical weakness Thoreau never picks up on, is that he could feed himself, do philosophy, and not need any society because his pencil factory dad sent him to Harvard and better transcendentalist Emerson let him borrow his freshly plundered native American land. Libertarianism works great if you can contrive a way to be left alone, but in real life you don't get left alone and not everybody gets to hide in the woods.</p>
<p>I like to think about his gross neck beard when he’s talking about other people’s poverty, but when he talks about his own poverty he’s uniquely profound. I love the parts of Walden where he just tabulates his stuff, like the materials that went into his house, his total labor to clean, or where he gets his food. It’s like caveman level literature and a true triumph of autistic art. Looser self help writers get abstract fast, but Thoreau will tell you true free thinkers eat nothing but raw corn meal and own less than one bucket.</p>
<p>Thoreau makes me want to keep all my school papers in a pile in case I need to burn them it for warmth, or power my laptop and light bulbs on a 9-watt solar panel. He makes me look at two chairs and think ‘that’s too many chairs’. He makes me uncomfortably aware of waste. The lobby for the ugly Temple architecture school could probably fit the livelihoods of a few dozen bean men. Free thinkers can get free things off the streets because the masses buy more glasses and drawers than they need. Nobody needs to spend that much on furniture if they’re cool with making rickety furniture. </p>
<p>In conclusion minimalism is fun but most minimalists are full of shit.</p>
