plung

Water can stay stuck in resovours for thosands of years between rides in oceanic jet streams.

Fun and playful like a cat rolling around on its head and back. To read an encyclopeida compleatly cover to cover, on must then again read it in the negitive space between the letters and lines, attempting to read the happenstance patterns like they themselves are a symbology. The cat ponders, drifting throught the chain links to each indivual item, from each indivual space.

Plung into your own head?

Mental capabilities I could imaine:

If you were a sleepy bunny, constantly tired and wishing to sleep, drinking out of a commically large paper coffee cup (rememeber you are still a bunny so everything you do is oriented twords cutness), you would want ot become the haunted rabbit. Haunted rabits hit leg day, state with fear and stand perfecly still. You would controll your sleepyness like your musculature, not a drowsy flutter, but an instant astral plunge, frozoen burried in the medow.

In silloutete a crow perches on the highest branche of a dead tree backed by the sky.

What human could live the life of a tree? Three turtles sit together on a floating plank. This is their haven, a pond by damed creek with a surface of floating green. In its destrubance the motion of turtules and snakes is made visable. Frogs croke from unseen groves by mashes edge. Fog's space is a niche occupiced by dragonflys. Forget the roadnoise, this is the counter example, density of life.

As sober as water though the body is far more saturated than pure water. Its influx over defines the vision and sharpens desire. Welcome to this water sober place, appoligies we've got no salt you are going to die.
