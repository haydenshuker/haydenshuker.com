<h2>Why Post HTML Documents That Strangers Will Never Read</h2>
<p><time datetime='2025-01-09'>January 9th 2025</p>
<p>What is this 2009? who cares about the internet. Homestuck-ass web-2.0 get real this is the 21st century post-covid utopia we make shortform now. How could websites not be important? They all got so big you forgot they were a ball of text you downloaded and threw away but they’ll always be the little bricks media is made of.</p>
<p>I love how fuzzy mediums are. You cannot confine photography to the box of photos. They get nailed to the wall everywhere and take over your life. I think about the rooms and houses of the real artists I know with floor to ceiling objects that make my perception work properly. What I want most is to be able to appreciate those things.</p>
<p>HTML is a great way to do that, it bleeds media. Look in my hard drive that’s where the blood goes. Songs, diagrams, photographs, collages, videos, poems, essays, typographic documents, programs, lists and common places. Dragging up the corpse of the <a href='articles/b1.html'>first blog post I’ve made</a> (I still like this one has a strong sense of voice), what we love are the artists and art of the channeling, not the channel itself but by god they need a channel.</p>

<h2>the wiki trap</h2>
<p><time datetime='2025-01-09'>January 9th 2025</p>
<p>Tech guys love wikis because they're a tech thing. Some evangelize making your own. Don't do that its stupid. I've seen so many dead personal wikis out there. You are not trying to birth the perfect article like an organization like Britannica would. Write articles as completed works and move on. Of course save your backlogs but don't let them conquer you.</p>
<p>The trick to writing hypertext is not to battle Wikipedia as stone faced repository of knowledge. Its a miracle they can even do that as regularly as they do.</p>

<h2>how I make a website</h2>

<ol>
<li>Domain registrar</li>
<li>Github pages hosts</li>
<li>Write with my custom static site generator</li>
<li>Post with git</li>

<h2><a href='articles/website-builder.html'>static site generator</a></h2>
<p>Websites are strange because the whole site is like a cohesive digital thing, but every page wants to be its own text file, so editing the whole can be laborious as if it were an actual physical object.</p>
<p>I write the content of a page by hand, the raw HTML. The templates like the header and footer are saturated in by my site generator so I can change every file at once. For anyone with a bit of coding a recommend making one as an easy project.</p>

<h2>design</h2>
<p>Semantic HTML force you to have a reasonable readable structure as opposed to a DIV jungle.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don't make it boring.</p>
