		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW6lg-7L7yk">Well There's Your Problem</a>: It's a political, engineering disasters podcast based in Philly. Its nice to hear some complaining about engineering rather than more of the same ‘triumph of man, caretakers of enlightened society’ rhetoric. This is the best episode because they cover some funny disasters; the runner-up in that respect is the Hindenburg Episode. Its cathartic to hear them tear apart all the dumb buildings that my education has been rubbing in my face since childhood.</p>
		<p><a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a>: Typography tutorial. I think it’s beautiful. Shoutout Practical Typography for every em-dash on this website.</p>
		<p><a href="https://ledergames.com/products/oath-chronicles-of-empire-exile">Oath</a>: Its a big ass board game that gets very emergent. I like how it trusts its system to make a story with minimal lore, primer or flavor text. The art is so full of character, every card is pfp material. It’s creation expresses a profound vision on what a game can be. No I've never played it.</p>

		<p><i>I’m putting hipster computing stuff in a separate category because I’m overexposed to it and I find it less interesting.</i></p>

		<p><a href=https://ploum.net/>Ploum</a>: Blog by a french hipster complains about the internet.</p>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Model_100">The TRS-80 Model 100</a>: I could imagine this thing would be more comfortable to write on than a clamshell laptop.</p>

		<p><a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/">Gemini</a>: Its an the internet but deliberately limited for hipsters. Browsing these websites is a fun artistic and philosophical experience, however the only people who use this are dweebs who only want to talk about hipster computing, so it’s all just boring prose. It serves no practical use because you can just make a good website with regular internet tools, but I did base this website on the limitations of Gemini pages. Its value is mostly something to point to rather than something to actually use.</p>
