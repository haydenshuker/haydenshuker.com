<h1>Love Despite Context</h1>
<p>At my friend's conservative parents house, they had a builtin bookshelf down to the builtin carpet in a geometrically complex, open-plan, staircase-ish form in the center of the downstairs meticulous greige quadruple everything room. In the cube inlet was a little gnome house. There are bookshelves for picking off like rotisserie chicken, and there are bookshelves for proving your command of the forms. The books were lined up intentionally in the back with titles like "WOKE SH!T" and "They the Triggered". In the foreground where a pair of porcine thrift store figurines, a boy and girl leaning far (far) forward air kissing three inches apart.</p>
