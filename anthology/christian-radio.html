<div class="center-box"><h1>christian radio</h1>
<p>The radio barly grabs a christain sation: "fucking terrorists… kill the… beat their wives… lying doctors… tunnel rats…." A man with a clockably and refreshily arab voice ofers a unique perspective on the quran that might just put these fucking terrorists into question. POV white forever-boy american tv-radio voice offers bratty playful pushback.</p>
<p>Driving for a moment at higher elevention, the radio rings with a lucid descirption of an american-made bunker-buster missle that can "punch through" a quarter mile of granite. Fucking terroists are holding a mountain hostage. Americans are advised not to buy cheap countertops overseas.</p>
<p>"I am success… Kill yourself…"</p>
<p>"psssssssss—shhhhhhhhh—pssssssss—shhhhhhh" This is clearly religion for old and stupid people. Whenever they come out with a new religion for young smart people it turns out it was for old stupid people the whole time and no one was young or smart enough to relise it. 'B' and 'C' students needing easy explainations. 'A' students who were just nurotic and good at taking tests needing justifications. Something to do on a sunday morning that dosn't give the impression of a compromised reaction agaist ones own kitch. Philosphy secularizes the god stuff to be an implicit rather than explit aestetic. The state collage region has several magic and occult stores and zero remaining hegal stores. Witchcraft and wild dishevelment is actaully a pretty acessable look here in the rust belt.</p>
