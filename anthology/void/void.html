<p>A starcase extends so far as their is void, showing no change or progression despite its length. Your eyes lack such a purity, for what you see compressess into one point perspective with concentrating visual artifacts in attempt to percive the furth and further. The material is graciously made of eternal marble. Pearing beneith the support for each step extends just as far down as it does up and forth. You climb barfoot, there is nothing that may harm your feet, eyes up and spine strait. Your skelliton gives the minimum force in rythem.</p>
<p>"Caw!" says the crow perched 20 steps above you. Its russeelling sillote has een visible for a 100 steps now. As you approch it beats its wings and flaps off. Against silence you hear it flide a slight disace. A new light energer, a second crow with a candlestick melted onto its head illuminates the rectangular top of an inonic collum extending as deep and the candle will go. You've become accustom to parketness. The staircase is visible though not following your expected geometric laws of light.</p>
