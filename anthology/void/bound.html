<p>10 steps above the hight of the laughing crows. Your back heal contours to the surface and flees upward over void giving the maximum length to run and bound. Your legs ripple with the knowlage of constant climb. Your muscles are as visble as anatolmy.</p>


<p>long exhalve concentrates air away from your brain. (this is the sort of thing best not thought about). You calm your nerves with a brisk counting, you remember you feel nothing at all.</p>
<p>The signal fires. Your lead leg digs forward snaping tword full extention. THe back rapidly catches up to strike the last fraction of matter with its ball and big toe and if the marblem can be dug through like soil. The force extends though your bones, bounding what there is to accellerate. Your foot exausts it touch till your frame moves freely relitive to itself having joined the void.</p>
<p>Ironic how any distance travaled is done with passivity. Newton would have loved this place. You miss the collum. You never would have been able to get enough distance. The birds humm to themselves as you fly.</p>
