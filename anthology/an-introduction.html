<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, every frame a painting, this is already hyperinflation. Back before the patriot act when people liked computers, somebody claimed the concept of a 'system novel' which was really just a regular novel but it took D batteries. Let me introduce you to Dr. Ology who recently pulled an outdate reference book of Pennsylvania geology out of the dirt. He felt like he needed to read something more grouned after spending his post-doc allowence on D batteries. Now, Pennsylvania is charming mass that is cleveryly non-rectanglar. Then it probably was too so how does a geology book get dated (thought Dr. Ology)? A picture is worth a thousand words and a rock is worth nothing and at this point in his life, Dr. Ology was sick of hearing specutation about how much a given thing was worth so he prefered something that was obviously worth nothing. </p>
<p>A rock is worth a thosand pebbles and a pebble is worth a thousand grains of sand and a grain of sand is worth how ever much the market would pay for it (Dr. Ology was no slouch when it comes to ecnomics). He took the book home, opened it on his sinky couch, thenrealised he didn't know any geology so a reference book on the gelogy of pennslvania would be worth nothing to him. He taught his five classes, went behind the school building and threw rocks at the windows, and in doing so made eleven dollars.</p>
<p>The gig economy ruined the word 'gig' which sounded really cool like it was coined by italian americans or even black people. The tech fiends of the 'system novel' accelerated the depleation of marketing copy and brand names because website names were divied on a first-come-first servce basis. How does it sound when you say it (they ask at the board meetings where the table is made of glass)? Do you sound young like an unfaulty child? Thats why gig workers have the indignity of being called that.</p>
<p>Dr. Ology was a gig worker. He owned a salvaged-titled PT cruiser from 9/11 which only had two wheels and the raio dial woudn't move so if the radio was turned on in and around state collage Pennsylvania, it would play a christian station at mostly comprehensible fidelity.<p>
