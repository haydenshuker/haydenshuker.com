<h1>Debating</h1>

<h2>dealing with crash housing</h2>
<p>Don't expect bedding. Hosts are not planning much so If you have camping gear to sleep on somebody's floor, bring it. At least bring a big coat.</p>
<p>There's usually not good food at competitions, no offense, especially if you have dietary limitations. Fortunately trips are short enough I can supplement them with a big box of <a href='cooking.html'>provisions</a>. Last time I brought 3 pounds of bacon like Oreagon Trail.</p>

<h2>case writing as essay writing</h2>
<p>My strategy for creative work is to force it out as fast as possible so I don't bounce off it. Case writing, especially defending, forces that speed giving you a sweet document in under an hour. Keep a debate case to essay pipeline open. Everything is debate practice, but debate practice is not the end.</p>
