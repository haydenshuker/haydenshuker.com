<h2>chapter i: preamble</h2>
<p>Do you really need a guide to have style? Everything's a style guide just look at someone who's not looking at their shoes or their phone or the walls or the ceiling or their pockets or their self in a reflection or the back of their hands or and nothing in particular and see what they do. There's the style. It comes free with everybody. You could have next to no money, you have one shirt. Are you going to tuck it in or let it hang? That's style and you probably have a shit ton of money. I see you wearing those gym shorts and those T-shirts when you could have worn anything else asshole.</p>

<h2>chapter ii: typography</h2>
<p>Fonts are to be plain and formal, preferably in serif for readability. Use minimal colors, black on white. Textual emphasis is to be used sparingly or not at all. Never use bold for textual emphasis. Never use underlines. Choose a font with true italics. Headings should by bold. Headings should only be subtly larger than body text. Headings should be closer to the body text below than the content above. Only use two levels of headings. Margins should be wide, most sentences should wrap. Left justify all text. Never use centered text. A page should never use decorative elements larger than 100 kb. Headings are never to be written in title case. Avoid exclamation marks in prose. Avoid ellipsis in prose. Never use both indentation and paragraph spacing. Prefer paragraph spacing. When using indentation do not indent the first paragraph. Use a single space after sentences. Never use a paragraph break for spacing. Avoid a manual line break except for cover pages and poetry. Always cite your sources. If you're just citing Wikipedia don't even bother. Avoid horizontal rules. write out single digit numbers in prose. Prefer unordered to ordered lists. Avoid short paragraphs unless dictated by the flow of the text.</p>
