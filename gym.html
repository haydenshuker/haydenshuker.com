<h2>Inherently fun</h2>

<p>My fitness goal is to feel like a worrystone all over. I think Miyamoto or one of those Nintendo guys said the Wii was fun because moving your body is inherently fun, and that’s why the Wii didn’t need to have good games. My fitness goal is opening up the path to be an oaf in case I need that.</p>
<p>As your muscles get bigger, the fun part is feeling them more. You develop a sense of how they activate and operate like fork lifts or excavators. If you’re weak everything takes your whole body, you can’t isolate that. I love seeing a new shaky guy at the gym. Maybe they have a surrogate big brother figure passing on the lore. The new people have so much to grow and we can feel their hope and potential in the air. My fitness goal is clairvoyance and extrasensory perception.</p>
<p>Body image is a beast. The focus for me is the focus for me, that, the most fun part, or enjoyable part should it not be fun, is the exercise in not exercising but just engaging with reality so purely? Some people don’t like the gym, I just think it feels good? Like the breathing and the straining, feeling like every moment your being is a statics diagram. The numbness and fatigue, stars in your eyes, twitches, pulls, drenched in sweat. “You’ve been in the woods for hours, you’re dehydrated, you’re delirious, you can’t tell if you’re sunburnt and in all that its really beautiful.”</p>
<p>I miss mountain biking. I’ve got a friend from Denver and he says he’s not that Denver, but sometimes he just says shit like “I wanna ski”. On the road its the gym stuff, you feel your body and the exertion in this musical rhythm. On the trail its that and its chopped like a stop in breathing to swallow spit, these textures roll through you like a like differential equations each phasing in, stacking up, and interfering so the flow is continuous till you get dropped off a ledge. Then new ledges come in at new rates, maybe a its a rock garden picking up the wheel or a series of foot high drops. Patterns emerge, and pattern of patterns emerge, and the layers mesh with a preference in your body, rowing your weight and dancing though the gears and brakes. Am I wasting your time explaining the universal and dead simple concept of flow?</p>
